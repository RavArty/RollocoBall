## History

This is my second project on Unity Engine. We've created this game alogn with my brother [AnvarArt] (https://github.com/AnvarArt).
This project was a result of my first trip to the USA. We were amused that there was a Roller coaster in each city we've visited (NY - Las Vegas - Los Angeles). And as a true developer, I wanted to reflect my feelings through my work. That's how this game was born.
